"2016/11/14 1:16:08 PM MST","What I've struggled most with is getting use to the terminology. The words that stand for functions. Essentially learning the language. technology and math is not as bad. ","more in depth analysis of the homework. Reviewing what we did and why. Slides are helpful. Homework and slides help the most.  ","I am excited to learn and perfect the language java. I know it will help me with other languages. I want to learn to be a good programer. I am struggling to understand new homework concepts. BUT! Even though they're hard to understand I spend hours outside of class trying to learn the concepts. I dont mind doing that and think its important but would like more review after homework assignments. Not necessarily before, because before would not encourage me to do work on my own, and maybe others. ","#1 will be getting myself to sit and do the work. Next semester is going to be a lot harder and time consuming and I fear slacking. I will have to be very vigourous with myself. Im not concerned with life only work. I enjoy having tools to refer too when lost, the sides and textbook have helped. ","Yes, I want more material.

"2016/11/14 5:06:55 PM MST","Most challenging has been the concepts and terminology. ","I would like to see more in class group work, whether they are on Java or small five minute discussions. If we do something related to Java, I would like to see more tutors/mentors assisting each table. It's hard to also help your partner and keep up at the same pace as lecture.","I thought building the apps was pretty exciting. I liked that we followed tutorials and that we also made a note taking one (though more challenging). It showed the capabilities of appinventor for novices. I am still struggling with using what we have learned in class and applying that to homework. Maybe 15 minutes of class should be how we should approach this problem like how we did with the add button in the note taking app. I thought that was helpful and made me think how to approach homework in a more logical schema.  ","1) Time management
2) Life balance

"2016/11/14 6:20:57 PM MST","Initially the technology was tough for me since I am a Mac/iPhone  user. Now I am having trouble with the math/logic and syntax. I feel like I can piece the puzzle together without understanding the shape of the pieces.","Definitely drop in open lab would be helpful so that I have a place to use the internet and ask questions as I do my assignments. I am finding myself looking up necessary and unnecessary things online so I get confused. The homework assignments are also too long. I would prefer to tackle one assignment per week rather than 4 questions per assignment.","I am so happy to have learned app inventor for the concepts, so now that we are using java I can understand how the commands are working together. The java syntax is tough and I wish we had a list of syntax so I can refer to it and type it by hand. Netbeans prompts for some syntax, but I don't feel as though I have all the options available for me to figure out the homework. ","1. Concepts - the math and loops are still difficult for me. 2. Time Management - I don't feel like I have enough time to really understand the assignments 3. Pace -this class moves super fast 4.work/life balance is always tough because programming has been taking me 15-20 hours per week outside of class.","I want to continue the program, but I wish there was another workshop during winter session that was strictly assignment based. Give us a problem, design a pseudo code, and code it ourselves all together in class. I knew computer science wasn't easy which is why I never thought I could do it. I had no idea how much math was involved and I now think I can do computer science, but I am really worried about how complicated it seems data structures will be.","Yes","1","3","3","5","5","15-20 hours per week","5","3","4","It would be great if they could be more involved with the class to know what we are learning so they am build upon what we are learning in class.

Unlike my experience in Biology at both the undergraduate and graduate level, I am of the impression that the information I am given in PINC CSc class(es) is only partial of what I need to learn and the rest(majority) will have to come from sourcing myself online or with collaboration with my other classmates. I expected there to be  in class work such as homework of problems given and then corrected in class.
